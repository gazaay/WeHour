<li><strong>Cross-Chain:</strong> Compatible across multiple blockchains</li>
</ul>

### VB$ (Badge Token) - Credentials & Proof
<div class="token-card">
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Immutable proof of participation</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Soulbound Token (SBT) - non-transferable</li>
<li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Rich information about event, role, impact</li>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> QR code verification for employers/schools</li>
<li><strong>Permanence:</strong> Non-expiring, fraud-resistant</li>
